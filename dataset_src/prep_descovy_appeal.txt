Dear [INSURANCECOMPANYNAME];

I am writing to request reconsideration of your denial of coverage of DESCOVY (emtricitabine 200mg/ tenofovir
alafenamide 25mg tablets) for PrEPÂ® (pre-exposure prophylaxis).
Based on the my condition and medical history, as well as my doctors experience prescribing PrEP, descovy
for PrEP is warranted, appropriate, and medically necessary in this case.

As you are likely aware, the ACA and subsequent regulations, require most health plans to cover PrEP with no co-pay. I do not believe our plan is exempt from this requirement.

Please see the Full Prescribing information for DESCOVY at www.descovy.com/hcp.

Sincerely,

[YOURNAME]
