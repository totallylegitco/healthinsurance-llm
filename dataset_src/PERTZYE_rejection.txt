Dear [Patient Name],

We are writing to inform you that your health insurance claim for PERTZYE has been denied. The reason for the denial is that your insurance plan requires step therapy for this medication.

You have not tried other, less expensive medications.
Your doctor has not documented why PERTZYE is the best medication for you.
The cost of PERTZYE is not significantly higher than the cost of other medications.

Step therapy is a process that requires you to try less expensive medications before your insurance company will approve coverage for more expensive medications. PERTZYE is a brand-name medication, and your insurance company may require you to try one or more generic alternatives before they will approve coverage for PERTZYE.

If your appeal is denied, you may be able to file a grievance with your state's insurance department. The insurance department will review your case and make a decision about whether to overturn the denial.
