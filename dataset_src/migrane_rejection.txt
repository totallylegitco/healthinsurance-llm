Dear Member;

We cannot approve your  Nerve decompression surgery request (procedures 64716, 64732, 21137, 64771) as it is not medically necessary. Anthem Medical Policy SURG.00096 (Surgical and Ablative Treatments for Chronic Headaches) states, "surgical treatment for chronic headaches is considered investigational."

You have the right to appeal.

Sincerely,

[HealthInsurancecompany]
