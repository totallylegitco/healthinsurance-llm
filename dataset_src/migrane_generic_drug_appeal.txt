To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to appeal the denial of my request for coverage for the prescription drug BUT/APAP/CAF TAB.

I have been diagnosed with migranes and have been taking BUT/APAP/CAF TAB for [length of time]. This drug has been very effective in controlling my symptoms and improving my quality of life.

BUT/APAP/CAF TABs are part of the standard treatment regiment for migranes; see https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/butalbital-acetaminophen-and-caffeine-oral-route/side-effects/drg-20075393?p=1#:~:text=Butalbital%2C%20acetaminophen%2C%20and%20caffeine%20combination,CNS)%20to%20produce%20their%20effects.

I understand that BUT/APAP/CAF TAB is not on Aetna's formulary, but I believe that it is medically necessary for me. I have tried other drugs that have not worked as well, and I have not had any serious side effects from BUT/APAP/CAF TAB.

I am requesting that you reconsider your denial and approve coverage for BUT/APAP/CAF TAB. I am confident that this drug will continue to be an effective treatment for my condition and that it will improve my quality of life.

I am also requesting any and all documents related to the denial, the formulary, and the decision making process used in constructing the formulary.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
