Dear [InsuranceCompany];


I am writing to appeal the denial of my health insurance claim for inpatient hospitalization at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

My child was diagnosed with [medical condition], and was in need of specialized care that could only be provided at St. Jude. St. Jude is a world-renowned children’s hospital that has a team of experts who are dedicated to providing the best possible care for children with cancer and other life-threatening diseases.

The standards of care for young children with cancer can not be viewed as complete, and [InsuranceCompany] should defer to our doctor's judgement.

I understand that HIP Health Plan of New York may be hesitant to approve coverage for inpatient hospitalization at a non-network hospital. However, I believe that the benefits of being treated at St. Jude outweigh the costs. St. Jude has a 90% survival rate for children with cancer, and it offers a wide range of support services for families, including financial assistance, housing, and transportation.

I respectfully request that you reconsider your decision and approve coverage for my inpatient hospitalization at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

P.S.

[InsuranceCompany] should think about the public relations impact of denying cancer coverage to a baby.
