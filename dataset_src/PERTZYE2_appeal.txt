Dear [InsuranceCompany]
I am writing to appeal [Name of Health Insurance Company]’s decision to deny
coverage for PERTZYE® (pancrelipase) which is prescribed for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to
cystic fibrosis. It is my understanding based on your letter of denial dated, [Date], that coverage has been denied as not medically necessary. As I have already tried many different medications without any effect I believe this should be covered.

Sincerely,

[YOURNAME]
