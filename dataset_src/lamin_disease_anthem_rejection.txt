Your request is important and personal to you and to us. Our decisions affect you. Because of that, our review included more than clinical guidelines and scientific data alone. Information about your health and your health plan were a part of it, too.

Details from the review (consider discussing with your doctor)
The request tells us your doctor ordered a device to be put under your skin to check your heartbeats (implantable ambulatory event monitor) for your condition (CHROMOSOME ABNORMALITIES). This device can be approved under the plan clinical criteria when all the following are met: 1) the person is at least 40 years old; 2) the person has passed out at least 3 times In the past 2 years (with no known cause): 3) other tests (including, but not limited to, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram) havenot shown what the problem is; and 4) another test (external ambulatory cardiac event monitor) has been done for at least 14 days and has not shown what the problem is. The information we have does not show this is the case for you. For this reason, the request is denied a not medically necessary. It may help your doctor to know we reviewed your request using the health plan clinical guideline called Implantable Ambulatory Event Monitors and Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (CG-MED-74).
