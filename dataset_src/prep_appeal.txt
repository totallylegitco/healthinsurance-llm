Dear [HEALTHINSURANCECOMPANY];

Most health plans are required to cover PrEP for free (see https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep/paying-for-prep/index.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20Affordable%20Care%20Act,need%20to%20maintain%20your%20prescription ) including requist lab testing and doctors appointments. I do not believe that you are exempt from this ACA requirement (which even applies to ERISA and many legacy plans). I request you re-consider this case.

I believe I am in heightened risk category for contracting HIV so PrEP should be covered.

Sincerely,

[MEMBER NAME]
