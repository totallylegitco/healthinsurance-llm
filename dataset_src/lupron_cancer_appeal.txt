Re: Coverage of LUPRON DEPOT-PED (leuprolide acetate for depot suspension)

Dear CVS Caremark & Harvard Pilgrim Health,

I am writing to request approval of LUPRON DEPOT-PED, it is perscribed to me to treat my breast cancer. I have tried a variety of treatment approaches including  high-frequency ultrasound without any success.

In past cases the New York State External Appeal has found Lupron Depot (1-Month) 3.75 intramuscular (IM) kit to be medically necessary -- see https://www.dfs.ny.gov/public-appeal/print-page/108836.


Sincerely,

[YourName]
