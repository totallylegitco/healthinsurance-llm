To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to appeal the denial of my health insurance claim for PERTZYE. I was prescribed PERTZYE by my doctor for the treatment of [medical condition].

My insurance plan requires step therapy for this medication. However, I have already tried other, less expensive medications for this condition, and they have not been effective. In fact, they have caused me to experience [side effects].

PERTZYE has been shown to be effective in treating my condition. It has also been shown to be safe and well-tolerated. I have been taking PERTZYE for [number of weeks] and I have not experienced any side effects.

I understand that my insurance company may be hesitant to approve coverage for a brand-name medication like PERTZYE. However, I believe that the benefits of PERTZYE outweigh the costs. PERTZYE is the only medication that has been effective in treating my condition, and it has helped me to improve my quality of life.

I respectfully request that you reconsider your decision and approve coverage for PERTZYE. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
