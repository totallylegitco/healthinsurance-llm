Dear [HealthInsuranceCompany];

I am writing to formally appeal the denial of coverage for the implantable ambulatory event monitor for my condition related to chromosome abnormalities. I understand that my request was deemed "Not Medically Necessary" based on the review conducted by your company. However, I strongly believe that the denial is incorrect, and I kindly request a reconsideration of this decision.

I believe there are significant factors that were not adequately addressed in the initial review, which warrant a reassessment of my case.

There are additional circumstances and complications that have not been adequately captured. These factors directly contribute to the necessity of the implantable ambulatory event monitor in effectively monitoring and managing my condition.

Secondly, I have undergone various diagnostic tests, including electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, which have failed to provide a conclusive diagnosis or identify the underlying problem. Despite these tests, the cause of my condition remains unidentified. The implantable ambulatory event monitor is crucial in obtaining further insights and potentially uncovering the root cause, enabling more accurate treatment and management.

Furthermore, I have already undergone an external ambulatory cardiac event monitor for the minimum required duration of 14 days, as outlined in the health plan clinical criteria. Regrettably, this test also failed to provide conclusive results. It is essential to consider the limitations of external monitoring methods in capturing irregular heartbeats and related events accurately. The implantable ambulatory event monitor is designed to overcome these limitations and offers a more comprehensive and continuous monitoring solution.

Regarding the age requirement of 40 years or older, which was mentioned in the denial, I would like to highlight the need for flexibility in this criterion. Each patient's medical condition and circumstances should be evaluated individually. While I may not meet the specific age requirement, my condition and symptoms necessitate careful consideration of the implantable ambulatory event monitor as a viable diagnostic and management tool.

To support my appeal, I have consulted with a cardiac specialist who agrees with the necessity of the implantable ambulatory event monitor in my case. Their expert opinion and insights can provide a valuable perspective on the medical necessity of this device for managing my condition effectively.

I firmly believe that a reconsideration of the initial decision is warranted based on the compelling factors outlined above. I kindly request a timely review of my appeal and a fair assessment of the medical necessity of the implantable ambulatory event monitor for my condition. I trust that your company will prioritize the well-being of its policyholders and make the appropriate determination in light of the new information presented.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a positive resolution to this appeal. Please feel free to contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address] if there is any additional information or documentation required.

Sincerely,

[YourName]
