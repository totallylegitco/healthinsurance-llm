Dear Valued Member:

We are writing to inform you of a coverage denial regarding requested services or items. This letter also summarizes your health benefit information, and gives the reason for this decision.

AIM Specialty Health (AIM) has been authorized by your health plan to provide management of the requested service(s).  As such, AIM is responsible for reviewing requests for the requested service(s) to ensure they are medically necessary and appropriate for payment purposes.

DETAILS ABOUT DENIED SERVICES OR ITEMS		I
Service: 172598614
Service/Item: 70336 MRI Scan of Jaw Joints
This request is denied as not medically necessary because: Your doctor told us that you grind your teeth. Your doctor ordered an MRI of your jaw. An MRI is a way to take pictures of the inside of your body. This test should be used when treatment has not helped. This treatment should include medicines that reduce pain and swelling, eating soft foods, and using a mouth guard. You also need to have x-rays or an ultrasound that fail to provide a diagnosis. Furthermore, you must be willing and healthy enough to have surgery. We reviewed the notes we have. The notes do not show that this is the case for you. Based on the information we have, this test is not medically necessary for you. We used AIM Specialty Health Guideline titled Imaging of the Head and Neck to make this decision. Yow may view this guideline at
