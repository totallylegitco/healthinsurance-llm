To Whom it May Concern at [Insurance Company Name]:
My name is [patient] and I am a policyholder of [insurance company]. I wish to file an appeal concerning
[insurance company name’s] denial of a claim for  Nerve decompression surgery. I received an Explanation of Benefits dated
[provide date] stating [provide denial reason directly from letter].
As is evident from my previous medical claims, I was diagnosed with [migraine/chronic migraine] on [date].
Unfortunately, there is significant impact to my daily life as evidenced by [explain symptoms]. I am currently
under the care of [doctor name] at [facility name]. In the Letter of Medical Necessity I attached, he/she
outlined why this [procedure] is clinically beneficial for me. He/she states, “[provide statement from letter that
supports treatment].” Please consult his/her letter for more significant medical history. As well, I have included
supplemental materials regarding the nature of the procedure and some additional details about the
procedure itself and the efficacy of it for my condition.
Please thoroughly review the provided documents and reconsider the previous adverse decision to allow
coverage of [procedure], as this treatment was necessary to my health. Should there be additional supporting
information you require to render a positive decision, please do not hesitate to contact me at [your phone
number] or my physician at [doctor’s phone number]. Thank you for your attention in this matter. Your prompt
consideration to this appeal is appreciated.
Respectfully Yours,
